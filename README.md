## A General Procedure of Organizing a Meetup

### The source information of a meetup

Usually, you will get the information about an activity that needs to be announced on the meetup by email from Martin and Benoit. If you find an interesting seminar that could be disseminated via the meetup, double-check it with Martin and Benoit.

The necessary information for announcing a meetup should include:
  1) The title of the seminar  
  2) When and where (zoom link/meeting room) the seminar will be held  
  3) An abstract of the topic
  4) A short biography of the speaker

If a meetup is held remotely, you can use Zoom to schedule a meeting so that you will get the Zoom link in advance. If a meetup is held on site, you can use [KTH Outlook Web App](https://webmail.kth.se/) to book a meeting room (more info [here](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/e-post-kalender/kalender/boka-moten/boka-avboka-mote-och-motesrum-via-webmailen-1.284849)).

Here is an example of the information: [Example event](https://www.meetup.com/kth-software-research-meetup/events/306590287/?eventOrigin=your_events)


### Announcing a meetup

You can use the feature `copy event` on one of the past events to reuse the structure. 

- Update the information for the new event
- Fill the blanks 
- Update the keywords for the specific event

Remember to make sure it is clear for new people how they can attend, e.g. by having accurate "How to find us" info, and filling in an additional "attending" section in the meetup event description, e.g.

> Attending: We will be available to open the doors on E-house's 4th floor approximately 10 minutes before the session.


#### Publishing

Click the `Publish` button at the bottom right corner. Note that all the members in the meetup will see the event after publishing it. If you are unsure about the page, click `save as draft` instead and send the preview link to Martin and Benoit for discussion. This is because all the organizers have access to review the drafts.

When the event is published, send the actual link to Martin, Benoit, and maybe the speaker also, to see if the page needs any revision. If everything is settled down, click the `announce` button on the event page so that all the members in the meet up will receive a notification about this event. You could also spread the news via the ASSERT mailing list.

**after announcing**: remember to pay attention to the comments on the event page. Sometimes we might have participants who ask questions there. You can turn on the notification for event updates via your account setting page: [https://www.meetup.com/account/](https://www.meetup.com/account/)

### Hosting a meetup

#### If the meetup is hosted online

If you are the host of the Zoom meeting, remember to start the meeting in advance (e.g., 5 mins before the event starts). It's also good to add someone as an alternative host, just in case you are not available during the meeting.

#### If the meetup is hosted on site

For some meeting rooms (e.g., room 4523 on our floor), external participants need our help to get inside the corridor. You can put a card which contains your contact information at the entry door. In this way, a participant could make a call to you if he/she arrives too early. You could also wait a little bit around the entry before the event starts.
